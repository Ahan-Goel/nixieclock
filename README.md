# nixieclock
Nixie Clock Project I worked on for my UIUC James Scholar Honors Project (ECE 220)

This project involved the research and design of a PCB that utilizes and Arduino to create a retro-themed clock using Nixie tubes.

To build this project it took a lot of research. From deciding how to control the tubes, to the firing and running voltages of the tubes, to parts selection. Using a off the shelf power supply (9v to 170v), along with 40 NPN BJT transistors, 48 resistors, and 5 SN747HC959 shift registers we can create a circuit that when controlled by a microcontroller can display digits on a nixie tube. I spent so many hours researching components, look at datasheets, understanding PCB design and schematic design, while also understanding things about Nixie tubes themselves.
